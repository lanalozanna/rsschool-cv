## **About me**

### Since childhood, I  was fond of Mathematics and loved to solve difficult problems. However,  I got higher education in a field that had nothing to do with Math. After working as an export manager, then working in the fitness industry, I finally decided to use my analytical mind and logical thinking, and began to study the front-end. My patience and attentiveness, as well as perseverance, help me in learning new information.
### I understand that the willingness to develop and study constantly is an important basis for everything, since in any field you need to keep up with the times and to know the latest updates in order to be a competent specialist.
